# Set-Game
A java based game I made after playing the card game Set. I did not invent the game idea this is simply a single person game that is made arond the rules of the game. The website for the original set game is here (http://www.setgame.com/)

A .jar file will be here if you want to see the game without having to compile.

To compile this program all images, sound, and java files should live in the same folder.
